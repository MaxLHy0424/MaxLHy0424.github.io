## Where to Place the Post Files



Your post files should be placed in `src/content/posts/` directory. You can also create sub-directories to better organize your posts and assets.

```
src/content/posts/
├── post-1.md
└── post-2/
    ├── cover.png
    └── index.md
```

## Posts alias

You can set a alias for any post by adding the `alias` field to the front-matter:

```yaml
---
title: My Special Article
published: 2024-01-15
alias: "my-special-article"
tags: ["Example"]
category: "Technology"
---
```

When a alias is set:
- The post will be accessible at the custom URL (e.g., `/posts/my-special-article/`)
- The default `/posts/{slug}/` URL will still work
- RSS/Atom feeds will use the custom alias
- All internal links will automatically use the custom alias

**Important Notes:**
- Alias should NOT include `/posts/` prefix (it will be added automatically)
- Avoid special characters and spaces in alias
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens for best SEO practices
- Make sure alias are unique across all posts
- Don't include leading or trailing slashes


## How It Works

graph LR
    A[User Password] --> B[Direct AES Decryption]
    B --> C{Check Prefix?}
    C -- "MIZUKI-VERIFY:" found --> D[Success: Render Content]
    C -- Random/Garbage --> E[Fail: Wrong Password]
```
